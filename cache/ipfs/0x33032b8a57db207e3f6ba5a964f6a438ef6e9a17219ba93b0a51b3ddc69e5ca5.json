For example, if an address held 20% of the total ubaAMPL supply, and ubaAMPL itself would be 20% of the aAMPL supply, the claims of that address would be the 4% of the total aAMPL. We appreciate the Ampleforth team providing us these \"internal\" holdings of ubaAMPL, given their knowledge of the system.\n- Only claims over value of 30 USDC have been included, given that gas-wise, would not be profitable to claim lower amounts. However, those values lower than 30 USDC will be naturally taken into account for the final follow-up distribution.\n- Once again, _this is an interim distribution, that will be follow up by another with more a precise numbers and bigger in size_.\n- For the sake of reducing complexity, the Aave governance proposal will release the whole 300'000 USDC, and the Ampleforth team can just transfer to the Aave Collector the 40% of that amount, removing any dependency for users to claim as soon as possible.\n- It is possible to check each address claims [HERE](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/8d5b3e902adf7c5c246e752b5d6b6e0e5d9831b7/src/20240409_AaveV2Ethereum_InterimAAMPLDistribution/distribution.pdf).\n\n## Specification\n\nThe distribution will be done via the [Merkl](https://app.merkl.xyz/) platform by Angle Labs, specialized on these operations and used before in other Aave DAO proposals, like the Merit program.\n\nUsers with a balance below 30$ will be excluded from this initial distribution as the gas-cost for claiming would not offset set amount claimed.\n\nTherefore the proposal will perform the following steps upon execution:\n\n- withdraw USDC from the collector (298.5k including a 0.5% fee for angle labs)\n- approve the full amount to [0x8BB4C975Ff3c250e0ceEA271728547f3802B36Fd](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8BB4C975Ff3c250e0ceEA271728547f3802B36Fd) which is the distribution creator by Angle Labs\n- sign the tos of https://app.merkl.xyz/ via a onchain transaction, a requirement on the Merkl platform\n- create a campaign to distribute funds to the affected users\n\n2 hours after proposal execution, users will be able to claim the USDC on https://app.merkl.xyz/\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV2Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/2244338d3cb5b0482ff3499bf8f95c0762cc004c/src/20240409_AaveV2Ethereum_InterimAAMPLDistribution/AaveV2Ethereum_InterimAAMPLDistribution_20240409.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV2Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/2244338d3cb5b0482ff3499bf8f95c0762cc004c/src/20240409_AaveV2Ethereum_InterimAAMPLDistribution/AaveV2Ethereum_InterimAAMPLDistribution_20240409.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xb7226dd6441b67225924082215f7a512bfd98252897ee43a879084e07ab53607)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aampl-interim-distribution/17184)\n- [Distribution:IPFS](https://angle-blog.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmb9uJbEdppQsL8W4aVKxREoHo42iXtcp4CV1FLE5tY8Rt)\n- [Distribution:formatted](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/2244338d3cb5b0482ff3499bf8f95c0762cc004c/src/20240409_AaveV2Ethereum_InterimAAMPLDistribution/distribution.pdf)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
