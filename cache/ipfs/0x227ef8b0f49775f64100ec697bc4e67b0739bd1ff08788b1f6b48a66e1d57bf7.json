As of February 3rd, approximately 290,310 ETH ($670M) in TVL has been deposited into the [ether.fi 1 ](http://ether.fi/) protocol, and XX has been natively restaked in EigenLayer.\n\n[Ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) stands as the pioneering decentralized and non-custodial delegated staking protocol featuring an LRT (eETH). A notable feature of [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is the control it provides stakers over their keys. The team behind the protocol is guided by the following principles:\n\n1. Decentralization is the foremost objective. [Ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is unwavering in its commitment to maintain the protocol’s non-custodial and decentralized nature, ensuring that stakers always have control over their ETH.\n2. [Ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) operates as a legitimate business with a sustainable revenue model, with the team dedicated to its long-term success. There is no place for deceptive or unsustainable financial practices.\n3. [Ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is committed to always acting in the best interest of the Ethereum community. In the event of any missteps, the team at [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) will take responsibility and swiftly rectify the situation.\n\nRisks:\n\n[ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/)’s LRT eETH is 100% redeemable. Users who deposit ETH into the protocol can withdraw their stake at any time. The holdings are publicly auditable on-chain and the protocol retains healthy reserves to offset any losses.\n\n## Proof of Liquidity and Deposit Commitments\n\nAnyone who deposits weETH into Aave will accumulate [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) and EigenLayer points to be used for future incentives.\n\nUsers are given eETH on a 1:1 basis with a minimum deposit of 0.001 ETH.\n\n[ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) is also the first LSP to natively restake on EigenLayer — a move that helps improve network efficiency and provides stakers with additional rewards for their network contributions. [ether.fi ](http://ether.fi/) has also launched a series of partnerships with DeFi protocols to incentivize users and drive liquidity (weETH) to various platforms.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe table below illustrates the configured risk parameters for [weETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xcd5fe23c85820f7b72d0926fc9b05b43e359b7ee)\n\n| Parameter                          |                                      Value |\n| ---------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------: |\n| Isolation Mode                     |                                       true |\n| Borrowable                         |                                    ENABLED |\n| Collateral Enabled                 |                                       true |\n| Supply Cap (weETH)                 |                                      8,000 |\n| Borrow Cap (weETH)                 |                                        800 |\n| Debt Ceiling                       |                                      USD 0 |\n| LTV                                |                                     72.5 % |\n| LT                                 |                                       75 % |\n| Liquidation Bonus                  |                                      7.5 % |\n| Liquidation Protocol Fee           |                                       10 % |\n| Reserve Factor                     |                                       15 % |\n| Base Variable Borrow Rate          |                                        0 % |\n| Variable Slope 1                   |                                        7 % |\n| Variable Slope 2                   |                                      300 % |\n| Uoptimal                           |                                       45 % |\n| Stable Borrowing                   |                                   DISABLED |\n| Stable Slope1                      |                                        0 % |\n| Stable Slope2                      |                                        0 % |\n| Base Stable Rate Offset            |                                        0 % |\n| Stable Rate Excess Offset          |                                        0 % |\n| Optimal Stable To Total Debt Ratio |                                        0 % |\n| Flashloanable                      |                                    ENABLED |\n| Siloed Borrowing                   |                                   DISABLED |\n| Borrowable in Isolation            |                                   DISABLED |\n| Oracle                             | 0xf112aF6F0A332B815fbEf3Ff932c057E570b62d3 |\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/aee28e9b93fc42841e7cc7cad997553ab885e46c/src/20240320_AaveV3Ethereum_WeETHListing/AaveV3Ethereum_WeETHListing_20240320.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/aee28e9b93fc42841e7cc7cad997553ab885e46c/src/20240320_AaveV3Ethereum_WeETHListing/AaveV3Ethereum_WeETHListing_20240320.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0xd5807ee6ec3d33e7d86805a4287540b0a9801430ee0900ff6babb698e4f2a273)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-onboard-weeth-to-aave-v3-on-ethereum/16758)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
