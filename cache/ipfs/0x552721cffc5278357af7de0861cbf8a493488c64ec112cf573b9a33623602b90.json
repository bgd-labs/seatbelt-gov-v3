  "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP is a continuation of AIP-284 and increases the Reserve Factor (RF) for assets on Polygon v2 by 5.00%, up to a maximum of 99.99%.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis AIP will reduce deposit yield for assets on Polygon v2 by increasing the RF. With this upgrade being passed, users will be further encouraged to migrate from Polygon v2 to v3.\n\nIncreasing the RF routes a larger portion of the interest paid by users to Aave DAO's Treasury. User's funds are not at risk of liquidation and the borrowing rate remains unchanged.\n\nOf the assets with an RF set at 99.99%, there is no change. All other asset reserves will have the RF increased by 5%.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe following parameters are to be updated as follows:\n\n| Asset | Reserve Factor |\n| ----- | -------------- |\n| DAI   | 61.00%         |\n| USDC  | 63.00%         |\n| USDT  | 62.00%         |\n| wBTC  | 95.00%         |\n| wETH  | 85.00%         |\n| MATIC | 81.00%         |\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV2Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/f2b8f4be71cda054e87d5d198022107eb0e51a04/src/20240102_AaveV2Polygon_ReserveFactorUpdates/AaveV2Polygon_ReserveFactorUpdates_20240102.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV2Polygon](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/f2b8f4be71cda054e87d5d198022107eb0e51a04/src/20240102_AaveV2Polygon_ReserveFactorUpdates/AaveV2Polygon_ReserveFactorUpdates_20240102.t.sol)\n- [Snapshot](No snapshot for Direct-to-AIP)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-reserve-factor-updates-polygon-aave-v2/13937/14)\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nTokenLogic and karpatkey receive no compensation beyond Aave protocol for the creation of this proposal.
