However, being a critical severity one, we think it is reasonable to have an ad-hoc governance proposal for this type of sizeable payment.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe governance proposal executes the payment to 2 different recipients:\n\n-> **White-hat**\n\n- Transfer of 500'000 aUSDT v2 Ethereum from the Aave Ethereum Collector.\n- Transfer of 5'583 AAVE (calculated to be $500'000 using a 30-days average) from the Aave Ecosystem Reserve. The amount has been determined following the recommendation of the financial service providers of the DAO [HERE](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-full-deprecation-of-stable-rate/16473/8).\n\n-> **Immunefi**\n\n- Transfer of 100'000 aUSDT v2 Ethereum from the Aave Ethereum Collector.\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/111a502c618f493409b593a0816c84a71b8e8e28/src/20240207_AaveV3Ethereum_StableRateBugBounty/AaveV3Ethereum_StableRateBugBounty_20240207.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/111a502c618f493409b593a0816c84a71b8e8e28/src/20240207_AaveV3Ethereum_StableRateBugBounty/AaveV3Ethereum_StableRateBugBounty_20240207.t.sol)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-full-deprecation-of-stable-rate/16473)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
