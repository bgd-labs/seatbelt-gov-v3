  "description": "\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis AIP will increase GHO borrow rate by 0.7% APR.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the evolving market dynamics and the increasing popularity of GHO as a stablecoin option, it is necessary to maintain competitiveness by aligning borrowing costs with average market rates. The current GHO borrow rate of 7.22% APR (~7.48% APY) no longer meets this requirement.\n\nAIP-381 allows for 100 bps increases in the GHO borrow rate every 7 days while maintaining rates up to 9.5% APR if the monthly average price of GHO stays outside a 0,995<>1,005 price range. The peg has shown improvement but remains below the target.\n\n| Monthly Average Borrow Cost (APR) | Stablecoin |\n| --------------------------------- | ---------- |\n| 10.45%                            | DAI        |\n| 10.89%                            | LUSD       |\n| 10.91%                            | USDC       |\n| 11.87%                            | USDT       |\n\nSource: [TokenLogic | GHO Analytics](https://aave.tokenlogic.com.au/stablecoin-rates)\n\nIncreasing the non-discounted borrow rate of GHO from 7.22% to 7.92% is proposed to remain competitive, increase protocol revenue, and not negatively affect the peg.\n\n## Specification\n\n- **Current Borrow Rate:** 7.22% APR - ~7.48% APY (non-discounted)\n- **Proposed Borrow Rate:** 7.92% - ~8% APY (non-discounted)\n- **Discounted Rates:** 30% discount\n- **New Discounted Borrow Rate:**\n  - GHO: ~5.6% APY\n\nIf required, ACI will monitor the GHO peg and use authorized discretion for further rate adjustments in coordination with @karpatkey_TokenLogic Aave finance SPs.\n\n## References\n\n- Implementation: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/65d02bff6ac92c3e4569f30b7f40add1fab7e2cc/src/20240308_AaveV3Ethereum_GHOBorrowRateIncrease/AaveV3Ethereum_GHOBorrowRateIncrease_20240308.sol)\n- Tests: [AaveV3Ethereum](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-proposals-v3/blob/65d02bff6ac92c3e4569f30b7f40add1fab7e2cc/src/20240308_AaveV3Ethereum_GHOBorrowRateIncrease/AaveV3Ethereum_GHOBorrowRateIncrease_20240308.t.sol)\n- Snapshot: No snapshot for Direct-to-AIP)\n- [Discussion](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-increase-gho-borrow-rate-08-03-2024/16885)\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",
