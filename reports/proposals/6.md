## Simple Summary

This proposal allows the Aave governance to activate the Aave V3 Bnb pool (3.0.2) by completing all the initial setup and listing CAKE, WBNB, BTCB, ETH, USDC and USDT as suggested by the risk service providers engaged with the DAO (Gauntlet and Chaos Labs) on the [governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-deployment-on-bnb-chain/12609/).

All the Aave Bnb V3 addresses can be found in the [aave-address-book](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-address-book/blob/main/src/AaveV3BNB.sol).

## Motivation

All the governance procedures for the expansion of Aave v3 to Bnb have been finished, said:

- Positive signaling and approval regarding the expansion on the [governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-v3-deployment-on-bnb-chain/12412/), [temp check snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x4579b562a4ea07c52871f724a8baf156514a97384e9427156d04fb6f0ae91515), and [final snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x60d44523a63e022fcca2f54aa3b84977e49fec0bdf15c9a298122422f6dd5902).
- Positive technical evaluation done by BGD Labs of the Bnb chain network, as described in the [forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-bnb-chain-infrastructure-technical-evaluation/13752) in detail.
- Positive risk analysis and assets/parameters recommendation by the service providers Gauntlet and Chaos Labs.

## Specification

The proposal will do the following:

- Set risk steward and freezing steward as the risk admin by executing `ACL_MANAGER.addRiskAdmin()`.
- Set the guardian address as the pool admin by executing `ACL_MANAGER.addPoolAdmin()`.
  This is following the standard procedure of keeping pool admin on the Aave Guardian during the bootstrap period, for security.
- Set the new pool impl by executing `ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.setPoolImpl()` to align with the current implementation on all networks.
- List the following assets on Aave V3 Bnb: CAKE, WBNB, BTCB, ETH, USDC and USDT.

The table below illustrates the initial suggested risk parameters for each asset:

## Security

The proposal execution is simulated within the tests and the resulting pool configuration is tested for correctness.

The deployed pool and other permissions have been programmatically verified.

In addition, we have also checked the code diffs of the deployed base contracts with the deployed contracts on Ethereum and other networks.

As a matter of caution, the `POOL_ADMIN` role will be given for the first weeks to the Aave Guardian multisig.
